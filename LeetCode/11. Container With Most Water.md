Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2. 
```
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int area = 0;
        int s = 0, e = height.length-1;
        while(s<e){
            int mLen=Math.min(height[s],height[e]);
            area = Math.max(area, mLen*(e-s));
            while(s<e && height[s]<=mLen) s++;
            while(s<e && height[e]<=mLen) e--;
        }
        return area;
    }
}
